Welcome to the CyberTraining-DDoS attack part!

In this training section, we're going to explore two types of DDoS 
Attacks, they are: TCP SYN flood attack and HTTP flood attack. 

Both the two attacks are implemented using Python language. Ubuntu
Operating systems are recommended to run the experiments. But 
macOS and Windows are also sufficient to run the experiments as 
Long as you can run Python programs and installed required 
Libraries successfully. 

We assume that everyone could run Python3 programs,If you have any
issues installing python programs, please refer:

https://www.python.org/
https://realpython.com/installing-python/

In these two websites, you can find information of how to install 
And run the latest Python language. 

To launch DDoS attacks, especially TCP SYN flood attack, we need 
to craft our own network packets. We could write it from scratch,
But that requires a lot of technical details about the network 
Layers and specifications. We stand on the shoulders of others in
This step and using a packet crafting library named as Scapy. For
More information about Scapy, please refer to:

https://scapy.net/

To use Scapy in our Python program, we need to install it in our 
System. You can refer to the following website for more 
information.

http://phaethon.github.io/kamene/api/installation.html

Please make sure that you can run the Scapy using root permission.
If not, you may have a problem of importing libraries from Scapy 
At the beginning of the program. 

If you have cleared all the errors, you should be able to run the
Hello world example in the main.py file. In the main.py file, we
Have four major sections of codes: Hello World example, multi-
Threading programming examples in Python, Socket programming exam
-amples and DDoS attack examples. Please remove the commented 
Quotes of that section if you want to run that section.

Running a real-world programming example successful can be 
Stressful and there have various problems that might prevent us 
From doing so. Please try your best to make these examples run 
Successful on your computer. We'll show you the details and run
The program in our training session!

Best of luck!
